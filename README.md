# Simple Start
I've created this extension as I always felt that other browsers had better new tab views than Firefox. I wanted to have a simple and minimalistic new tab view that would allow me to organize my bookmarks into categories. 
This is something that I use daily across different devices so there's no reason to be worried that this extension will no longer be supported and it's still highly updated.

## ü§ù Contribution:
I strongly encourage to contribute to development of Simple Start extension. Bugs reports and new features suggestions can be made by creating a new issue - with appropriate title and description please.

**To test it locally, you need to follow this steps:**
* Make sure you have `yarn` installed on your machine.
* Run `yarn install` in the root of the extension.
* To start in development mode (with watcher aka "auto-refresh"), run `yarn dev` in the root of the extension.
  * When developing for Chrome you need to run `BROWSER=chrome yarn dev` instead.
* Add the extension to your Firefox, by going to `about:debugging` page, `This Firefox` tab and loading *Simple Start* as a temporary add-on by choosing the `dist/manifest.json` file. 

* Run `yarn build` to create a "production" build or `BROWSER=chrome yarn build` for Chrome. Keep in mind that it may be required to delete the `dist` folder before running the build command for a different browser.

## üì¶ Favicon Service
Simple Start uses [Besticon](https://github.com/mat/besticon) to provide users with correct icons for each and every website. It's an open-source favicon service, written in Go.
It's hosted on [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) from docker image, and with both the Prometheus metrics and the HTML pages disabled via the environment variables so no metrics are collected.

## üìù License:
Simple Start extension is open-source project licensed under the [GLP-3.0 license](LICENSE).
